This repository demonstrates a race condition that can occur in Firebase's Realtime Database when multiple clients concurrently update the same data using transactions. The bug is reproduced by simulating two clients attempting to increment a counter simultaneously.  The solution showcases using optimistic locking strategies and server-side timestamps to resolve the inconsistency.
